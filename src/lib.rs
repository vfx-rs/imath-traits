//! imath-traits provides a set of traits which constrain the types used in Rust translations of
//! C++ APIs that rely on `Imath`, or `Imath-alike` types.
//!
//! This is solely about memory layout and being able to convert the implementing types back and
//! forward into slices and pointers to be able to be used in the FFI call, thus the traits contain
//! no methods other than for converting back and forth between slices and raw pointers.
//!
//! To use, simply add the feature for the math crate you need to the dependency
//! of any crate that uses imath-traits (these will be called `imath_<crate>`, and types will just work with any function
//! from that crate that expects a Vec2<T>, Vec3<T>, Vec4<T>, Bound2<T> or Bound3<T>:
//!
//! ```toml
//! openexr = { version = "0.10-3.0.1", features=["imath_cgmath"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Currently, we support glam, nalgebra and nalgebra_glm. If you need another math
//! crate, implement support for it and submit a PR, or request it. Note that the
//! crate must support 2-, 3- and 4-dimensional vectors of i32, f32 and f64.
//!
